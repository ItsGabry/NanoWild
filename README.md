This plugin allows you to teleport to random coordinates.
When you do / wild the plugin will choose a random safe location to teleport to, you won't risk getting stuck in some block or dying.
Once the command is sent you will have to wait 10 seconds and there will be a countdown of the remaining seconds.
From the config you can choose the maximum range of coordinates, and the list of worlds where / wild will work.
