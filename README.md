Features:

- This plugin allows you to teleport to random coordinates.
- When you do /wild the plugin will choose a random safe location to teleport to, you won't risk getting stuck in some block or dying.
- Once the command is sent you will have to wait 10 seconds and there will be a countdown of the remaining seconds.
- From the config you can choose the maximum range of coordinates, and the list of worlds where /wild will work.
